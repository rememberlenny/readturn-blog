Me:
remember the sendlater thing I was working on?
Im making an email interface
so you email the service with an email address noting how long it should wait, then it sends you an email after that length of time
ie. 20minutes@sendlater.io
or tomorrowmorning@sendlater.io
you preregister, so it recognizes your email address and then replies back

JJ:
ha thats funny
why are you making it again

Me:
i use email to “hold on to” things that I want to go back to
instead of evernote or instapaper
so I want to create a way to buffer an email

JJ:
you know the app mailbox?
it does that – when you get an email you can tell it to send it again later

Me:
yep
this is more from a desktop standpoint
or even if its not an email you are receiving
ie, using the mail to function
or copying content and then sending it to yourself
